# A to do app with flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a simple To do app made with flutter. I made this just to have some hands on experience with flutter.

# How to install

Clone the repository
Open terminal in the directory of the repository
Run: flutter pub get
Run: flutter build apk --release

Then you can find the release apk file inside build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
